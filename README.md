# Writing Samples

Included in this repo are several writing samples from technical writing.

## App Punch Out Policies - Bixby Developers

The [App Punch Out Poliices](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/App%20Punch%20Out%20Policies%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) file is a design guide meant to help UX designers when handling app punch out policies. I wrote the majority of this document by myself, with editorial help from the lead designer at Viv Labs. Written in 2020.

## Planning a Capsule - Bixby Developers

The [Planning a Capsule](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/Planning%20a%20Capsule%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) file is a developer guide, but is also for more casual audiences such as project/product managers, designers, and beginner developers. It guides users on the various steps needed to create a Bixby capsule. (A Bixby capsule is similar to a Google Action or an Alexa Skill.) It was written primarily by myself, with guidance and review from a project manager at Viv Labs.

## Training Best Practices - Bixby Developers

The [Training Best Practices](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/Training%20Best%20Practices%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) guide is a more advanced developer guide that describes best practices when creating and annotating training examples for Bixby capsules. I wrote this guide primarily by myself, based off a talk given by the lead data scientist at Viv Labs. It was reviewed by a different data scientist, and edited and updated later by other tech writers.

## Writing Sample 2 and 3

[Writing Sample 2](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/WritingSample2_AnneJuan.pdf) and [Writing Sample 3](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/main/WritingSample3_AnneJuan.pdf) are troubleshooting and FAQ guides that was written for a tool I developed when I was a software developer for the DocTools team at Oracle. JDocLint is a Java-based tool, available both as a module in oXygen XML Editor and a CLI tool, that takes an XML document and reports various warnings and errors about the document. The warnings and errors cover XML-schema issues, editorial problems, broken links, out-of-date legal files, etc. 

## capsule-info - Bixby Developers

The [`capsule-info`](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/main/capsule-info%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) reference page was written by me as part of the Bixby SDK. I helped created the code samples on the page as well, with some help from other developers on the localized versions of the samples.
