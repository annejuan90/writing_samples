# Writing Samples

Included in this repo are several writing samples from technical writing.

## App Punch Out Policies - Bixby Developers

The App Punch Out Poliices file is a design guide meant to help UX designers when handling app punch out policies. I wrote the majority of this document by myself, with editorial help from the lead designer at Viv Labs. Written in 2020.

## Planning a Capsule - Bixby Developers

The Planning a Capsule file is a developer guide, but is also for more casual audiences such as project/product managers, designers, and beginner developers. It guides users on the various steps needed to create a Bixby capsule. (A Bixby capsule is similar to a Google Action or an Alexa Skill.) It was written primarily by myself, with guidance and review from a project manager at Viv Labs.

## Training Best Practices - Bixby Developers

The Training Best Practices guide is a more advanced developer guide that describes best practices when creating and annotating training examples for Bixby capsules. I wrote this guide primarily by myself, based off a talk given by the lead data scientist at Viv Labs. It was reviewed by a different data scientist, and edited and updated later by other tech writers.

## Writing Sample 2 and 3

Writing Samples 2 and 3 are troubleshooting and FAQ guides that was written for a tool I developed when I was a software developer for the DocTools team at Oracle. JDocLint is a Java-based tool, available both as a module in oXygen XML Editor and a CLI tool, that takes an XML document and reports various warnings and errors about the document. The warnings and errors cover XML-schema issues, editorial problems, broken links, out-of-date legal files, etc. 

## capsule-info - Bixby Developers

This reference page was written by me as part of the Bixby SDK. I helped created the code samples in the page as well.
