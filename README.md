# Writing Samples

Included in this repo are several writing samples from my technical writing career. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at <anne.juan90@gmail.com>.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-michelle-juan/).

## Bixby Developers 

These examples are static copies of documentation I wrote or helped write from the [Bixby Developer Center](https://bixbydevelopers.com/). Bixby is Samsung's virtual voice assistant, similar to Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. I help write the developer documentation that allows developers to incorporate their services into Bixby.

### App Punch Out Policies

The [App Punch Out Poliices](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/App%20Punch%20Out%20Policies%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) file is a design guide meant to help UX designers when handling app punch out policies. I wrote the majority of this document by myself, with editorial help from the lead designer at Viv Labs.

### Planning a Capsule

The [Planning a Capsule](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/Planning%20a%20Capsule%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) file is a developer guide, but is also for less technical audiences such as project/product managers, designers, and beginner developers. It guides users on the various steps needed to create a Bixby capsule. (A Bixby capsule is similar to a Google Action or an Alexa Skill.) It was written primarily by myself, with guidance and review from a project manager at Viv Labs.

### Training Best Practices

The [Training Best Practices](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/Training%20Best%20Practices%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) guide is a more advanced developer guide that describes best practices when creating and annotating training examples for Bixby capsules. I wrote this guide primarily by myself, based off a talk given by the lead data scientist at Viv Labs. It was reviewed by a different data scientist, and edited and updated later by myself and other tech writers.

### Localizing Capsules

The [Localizing Capsules](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/cdaf8be731ee26ecd6ccabcc50226a868e433e26/Localizing%20Capsules%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) document is an advanced guide that helps Bixby developers understand how to set up and format their capsule to utilize localization services. I wrote this guide by myself, with a review from a PM at Viv Labs. I have updated and edited a few times, as the platform has evolved, but no other writer has added or edited this heavily edited this content.

## capsule-info Reference Page

The [`capsule-info`](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/main/capsule-info%20_%20Bixby%20Developer%20Center.pdf) reference page was written by me as part of the Bixby SDK. I helped created the code samples on the page as well, with some help from other developers on the localized versions of the samples.

## Internal Tools Documentation

The following guides were written when I was a software developer for the Documentation Tools team at Oracle, but changed slightly and submitted for a technical writing course I took at UC Berkeley extension school.

### JDocLint User Guide and FAQ

[Writing Sample 2](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/8d0b48b23ecafc3a4992a0a34b7e0242f6f12416/WritingSample2_AnneJuan.pdf) and [Writing Sample 3](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/main/WritingSample3_AnneJuan.pdf) are troubleshooting and FAQ guides that was written for a tool I developed when I was a software developer for the DocTools team at Oracle. JDocLint is a Java-based tool, available both as a module in oXygen XML Editor and a CLI tool, that takes an XML document and reports various warnings and errors about the document. The warnings and errors cover XML-schema issues, editorial problems, broken links, out-of-date legal files, etc. 


## Oracle Developer Studio

I was a technical writer for [Oracle Developer Studio 12.5](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E60778_01/) and the lead technical writer for [Oracle Developer Studio 12.6](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E77782_01/). These are a few static copies of documents that I helped write. 

### What's New 12.6

The [What's New guide](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/63d05d706d016bba1f4179a6591359367ef01561/ODS-12.6-WN.pdf) notes new features available in the 12.6 release of Oracle Developer Studio. I wrote the majority of this doc myself, minus the legal/boilerplate information, with input from the engineering and product teams.


### Release Notes 12.6

The [Release Notes](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/63d05d706d016bba1f4179a6591359367ef01561/ODS-12.6-RN.pdf) list limitations and other known issues with the Oracle Developer Studio 12.6 release. I wrote the majority of this doc myself, minus the legal/boilerplate information, with input from the engineering and product teams.

### IDE Quick Start 12.6

The [IDE Quick Start Tutorial](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/5d20bee2566f5720670ac3e6d37a3bf700ac5fc9/IDE-QS-12.6.pdf) helps developers quickly get acquainted with Oracle Developer Studio 12.6's IDE. I heavily edited and updated this document, including adding new screenshots and updating code examples.

### Code Analyzer User's Guide 12.5

The [Code Analyzer User's Guide](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/5d20bee2566f5720670ac3e6d37a3bf700ac5fc9/CA-UG-12.5.pdf) helps developers learn about the Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 Code Analyzer tool, which helps developers find common programming issues in their C and C++ applications. Code Analyzer is available as both a command-line and GUI tool. I edited and updated this document, added information about new features, such as new test suites available, and udpated screenshots where necessary.

### dbxtool Tutorial 12.5

The [dbxtool Tutorial](https://github.com/annejuan90/writing_samples/blob/main/dbxtool-tutorial-12.5.pdf) helps developers get acquainted with the GUI version of dbx, the debugging tool for Oracle Developer Studio 12.5. I updated this document to match the new UI, including new screenshots and updated code examples, as well as fixing any outdated information.
